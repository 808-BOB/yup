# Multi-Step Form Implementation for Create Event page

Steps to be implemented in the form:
1. Step 1: Image through time fields
2. Step 2: Location through Description fields  
3. Step 3: The remaining RSVP settings fields

The form needs to be restructured to include:

1. Progress bar at top showing step completion
2. Previous/Next buttons for navigation between steps
3. Only show form fields relevant to the current step
4. Only allow form submission on final step
5. Keep "Cancel" button available on all steps

These changes will help break up the long form into manageable sections for better user experience.
