# Recent Changes

## UI Changes: Archives Feature

### Completed
- Changed the "Completed" tab to "Archives" throughout the application
- Added a text-based "View Archives" link at the bottom of all tab views instead of having it as a tab
- Modified the badge in event cards from "Completed" to "Archived"
- Added toggle functionality to the archives link ("View Archives" / "Back to Active Events")
- Fixed date comparison logic in the event card component for better stability

### File Changes
- `client/src/components/view-selector.tsx`: Added text-based "View Archives" link
- `client/src/components/event-card.tsx`: Changed "Completed" badge to "Archived" 
- Fixed date comparison logic for past events

### Technical Notes
- Implemented the archives link to toggle between active events and archived events
- The UI now shows the View Archives link at the bottom of the tabs panel
- When clicked, it toggles to show archived events and the link text changes to "Back to Active Events"

## Bug Fix: Event RSVPs Navigation

### Completed
- Fixed the issue where clicking "View RSVPs" on events with missing slugs showed "Event not found"
- Added support for handling both slug and numeric ID based routes for event responses
- Improved error handling to gracefully handle undefined values

### File Changes
- `client/src/components/event-card.tsx`: Modified "View RSVPs" button to fallback to event ID if slug is missing
- `client/src/pages/event-responses.tsx`: Updated to handle both slug and ID based routes
- `client/src/App.tsx`: Added support for ID-based route `/events/:id/responses`

### Technical Notes
- Added logging to help pinpoint the exact issue (event URLs showing as undefined)
- The application now correctly navigates to the responses page using either the event slug or ID
- Events with missing slugs can now have their RSVPs viewed using the numeric ID fallback route

## Feature: Shareable Event Response Preview Card

### Completed
- Created a visually appealing shareable card for events that shows event details and response status
- Added a comprehensive sharing modal with multiple sharing options (link, email, SMS)
- Implemented a preview tab to show users exactly how their shared event will look
- Integrated the card with the existing event cards to enable easy sharing

### File Changes
- `client/src/components/shareable-event-card.tsx`: New component for the shareable card preview
- `client/src/components/share-event-modal.tsx`: New modal component with sharing options
- `client/src/components/event-card.tsx`: Updated to include the share functionality
- `client/src/lib/utils/date-formatter.ts`: Added utility for consistent date and time formatting

### Technical Notes
- The shareable card includes branding elements (logo) for premium users
- Share modal provides multiple ways to share: direct link, email, SMS, and system share API (if available)
- The card displays event details (title, date, time, location) and the user's response status
- Uses native Web Share API when available, with fallbacks for all browsers
