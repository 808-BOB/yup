# Simple Storage Bucket Setup (Alternative Method)

Since you're getting permission errors with the SQL approach, here are simpler alternatives:

## Option 1: Use Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard** → Storage
2. **Click "New Bucket"**
3. **Create bucket named**: `profile-pics`
   - ✅ Public bucket: **YES**
   - ✅ File size limit: **5MB**
   - ✅ Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif`
4. **Create bucket named**: `event-pics`
   - ✅ Public bucket: **YES** 
   - ✅ File size limit: **10MB**
   - ✅ Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif`

## Option 2: Keep Using Base64 (Current Working Solution)

The app is currently working with base64 image storage, which:
- ✅ **Works immediately** (no bucket setup needed)
- ✅ **No permission issues**
- ✅ **Same visual result**
- ⚠️ **Stores larger data** in database (but fine for profile pics)

## Option 3: Minimal SQL (If Dashboard Doesn't Work)

If the dashboard bucket creation doesn't work, try this minimal SQL:

```sql
-- Just create the buckets (without policies)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('profile-pics', 'profile-pics', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('event-pics', 'event-pics', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

## Current Status

Your profile picture upload is **already working** with base64 storage! 
- The error you saw was only for setting up optional storage buckets
- The app will continue working perfectly with the current approach

## When to Migrate to Storage

Consider using storage buckets later if:
- You have many large images (>1MB each)
- You want faster image loading
- You need advanced image processing

For now, the base64 approach is perfectly fine for profile pictures!
