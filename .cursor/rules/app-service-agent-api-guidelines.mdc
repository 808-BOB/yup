# App Service & API Agent Guidelines

**(Yup.RSVP, Next.js Monorepo, Migrating to Supabase, Vercel)**

---

## 1. Code Quality & Modularity
- Write modular, readable, and well-documented TypeScript code.
- Place shared logic (such as email invites, analytics, or data validation) in monorepo packages (e.g., `/packages/common`).
- Avoid duplication between agent and backend—use shared packages.

## 2. Environment & Secrets Management
- Store all secrets and config in `.env.local` files (never in source).
- Use Vercel project environment variables for all staging and production secrets.

## 3. Asynchronous Logic & Error Handling
- Use `async/await` for all asynchronous operations—no callbacks.
- All API agent routes use a central error handler (middleware or utility).
- Validate input with Zod or Yup before processing any user/event data.

## 4. API Client Integration
- All API clients must be typed (tRPC or OpenAPI for API calls).
- Keep internal API logic isolated from page rendering logic.

## 5. Performance & Efficiency
- Optimize agents for fast cold starts (Vercel serverless best practices).
- Minimize memory use; avoid in-memory state for scalability.

## 6. Testing & Reliability
- Write and maintain tests for all critical agent logic.
- Use Vitest or Jest for isolated tests inside the monorepo.
- Mock all external calls (Supabase, Stripe, email) in tests.

## 7. Documentation
- Document every exported function (JSDoc or Markdown).
- Keep an `AGENT_GUIDELINES.md` in the monorepo root.

## 8. CI/CD & Deployment
- Ensure agent logic is covered by automated CI checks (type check, lint, test).
- No PR is merged without a passing Vercel preview.

## 9. Supabase Migration
- Move all data operations to Supabase Postgres (managed via Supabase dashboard).
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication; migrate session logic from express-session or NextAuth to Supabase Auth.
- Use Supabase Edge Functions for custom server-side logic.
- Use Supabase storage for file and image uploads.
